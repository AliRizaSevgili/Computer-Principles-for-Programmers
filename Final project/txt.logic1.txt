1.Start                                                                                 Variables:
                                                                                           totalareaPaintng;BaseCoatsCount;
2.Ask client for the totalareaPainting => totalareaPainting*                               FinishingCoatsCount;BaseCoatsTotal;
                                                                                           FinishingCoatsTotal;
3.Ask the client - Do you want Base paint?                                                  
 if is YES:
  
     -ask the client how many coast => BaseCoatsCount*

4.Ask client - Do you want Finishing Paint?
    if is YES:

     - if BaseCoatsCount = 2;
            - FinishingCoatsCount = 1 (need);

     - if BaseCoatsCount = 1;
            - FinishingCoatsCount = 2 (need);

     - if BaseCoatsCount = 0;
            - FinishingCoatsCount = 3 (need);

5. Output total the number of coats for BasePaintingTotal:
 
    => BaseCoatsTotal = BaseCoatsCount*(totalareaPainting/11)

6. Output total the number of coats for FinishingPaintingTotal:

      - if BaseCoatsCount = 2; => FinishingCoatsTotal = totalareaPainting/16;

      - if BaseCoatsCount = 1; => FinishingCoatsTotal = 2*(totalareaPainting/16);
      
      - if BaseCoatsCount = 0; => FinishingCoatsTotal = 3*(totalareaPainting/16);
